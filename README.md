### Usage

#### Check for new shares

You can check your shares by running `python get_shares.py`. If you want to
run it periodically and send you a Telegram message, you can configure crontab:

1. Open the terminal and edit the crontab:
```
crontab -e
```
2. Add the cron job to run the script from the folder where your .env file is
   located. For example, if your script is in /path/to/folder, you can add:
```
   0 8 * * * cd /path/to/folder && /usr/bin/python3 notify_new_shares.py >> logfile.log 2>&1
```
3. This would run the script every day at 8AM.

#### Transfer

In a terminal, run `python transfer.py`.
Selenium will open a headless Chrome window (aka you won't see anything) and automate the transfer of all whole shares to your chosen brokerage.

You must first configure a brokerage account with `DTC` and `ACCOUNT_NUMBER` in the UI.

#### Sell

An electronic payment needs to be setup for a sale to avoid fees and charges.

In a terminal, run `python sell.py`.
Selenium will open a headless Chrome window (aka you won't see anything) and automate the sale of all shares to the first electronic payment option.

Multiple electronic payment options have not been tested.

# Warning

This will transfer all whole shares to your chosen brokerage or sell all shares to the first electronic payment option.

Use at your own risk.
